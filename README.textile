h1. Tracker

This project was created for the Wayra Developer Day Colombia 2012.

It's a simple Web Application that shows the number of posts/tweets/commits that you have generated today - and the last 7 days -. By default, it will show only Facebook updates but you can activate other "services" as well (currently Twitter and Github are available).

Additionally, it will generate a nice graph of the last 7 days comparing the activity of your "services".
